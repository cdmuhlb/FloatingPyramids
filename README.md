FloatingPyramids
================

FloatingPyramids performs dynamic range reduction on images using Laplacian
pyramids.

The algorithms used are described in the papers [Local Laplacian Filters:
Edge-aware Image Processing with a Laplacian
Pyramid](http://people.csail.mit.edu/sparis/publi/2011/siggraph/) and [Fast and
Robust Pyramid-based Image
Processing](http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/67030).

Dependencies
------------
FloatingPyramids requires CUDA 5.0 or later, OpenCV, and a Linux-compatible
build environment.
